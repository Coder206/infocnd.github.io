<strong><u><center> Sentences </center></strong></u>
<br>A sentence almost always has three features
<br>1. A subject
<br>2. A verb
<br>3. A complete thought
<br><br>
Three types of sentences will be presented here:
<br>1. Simple Sentences
<br>2. Compound Sentences
<br>3. Complex Sentences
<br><br>
<strong>Simple Sentences:</strong> 
<br>A Simple sentence is one independent clause (IC).<br><br>
<u>Examples:</u>
<br>
<i>Mr. Shipley travelled to Canada last fall.
<br><br>The old truck was pulled by a team of horses.
<br><br>Bram rarely mowed the lawn.</i>
<br><br><strong>Compound Sentences:</strong>
<br> A Compound sentence is composed of two or more independent clauses (ICs).
<br><br>
<u>Examples:</u>
<br><i>
Mr. Shipley travelled to Canada last fall but he hadn't the money to do any sightseeing.
<br><br>
The old truck was pulled by a team of horses, so that john could save on the cost of fuel.
<br><br>
Bram rarely mowed the lawn, and he never fixed the fence poles either.
</i><br><br>
Problems frequently occur when two simple sentence (ICs) are being joined to make a compound sentence. 
These problems are called run-on sentences. These may have a period as its only punctuation mark OR 
it may be inappropriately punctuated with one or more commas 
(this type of run-on sentence is called a "comma splice").
<br><br>
<u>Example:</u>
<br><br><i>
John can't wait to go to the dance Arlene attends weekly.
</i><br><br>
<strong>Comma splices</strong>
<br><br>
<u>Examples:</u> 
<br>
<i>John can't wait to go to the dance Arlene attends weekly. </i>
<br><br>
1. Use a period to separate the intendent clause into sentence.
<br>2. Use a semicolon to separate the independent clauses within a single sentence. 
<br>3. Use a coordinating conjunction and a comma to join the two clauses Comma slices.
<br><br>
<u>This is a comma splice:</u><br><i> John is going to the dance, Arlene attends every week.</i>
<br><br>

<u>This is how to fix it:</u> 
<br>Use a semicolon, a transitional expression, and a comma.
<br><br>
<i>John is going to the dance; likewise, Arlene is also going.
<br><br>
Hagar is a very wise woman; However, she is beginning to change her ways in old age.</i>
<br><br>
<strong>Complex Sentences:</strong>
<br><br>
A Complex sentence is composed of one independent clause with one or more subordinate (dependent) clauses.
<br><br>
A subordinate (dependent) clause is of secondary importance in a sentence and depends on an independent clause to make a sentences.
<br><br>
<u>Examples:</u>
<br>
<i>Because he was late for work, he had to work in the evening.
<br><br>
If we all pool our money, we ca buy you a university education.
<br><br>
Murray befriended Hagar who looked this and forlorn.</i>
<br><br>
**Note the placement of a comma after the dependent clause.**
<br><br>
When the dependent clause is at the beginning of a sentence, the pattern is the following:
<br>DC, IC (DEPENDENT CLAUSE, INDEPENDENT CLAUSE)
<br><br>
When the dependent clause is at the end of the sentence, there is no comma needed.
<br>
ID DC (independent clause dependent clause)
<br><br>
<strong>Sentence fragments:</strong>
<br><br>
A sentence fragment is a piece of information that is punctuated as a sentence but that lacks some of the characteristics of a complete sentence.
<br><br>
<u>Example:</u>
<br><i>Tired of having to ask her for help.</i>
<br><br>
The statement does not have a subject; we do not know who is tired of having to ask her to help.
<br><br>
How to fix it: add a subject.
<br><i>Hagar is tired of having to ask her for help.
<br><br>
Tombstones in the Manawaka cemetery.</i>
<br><br>
The statement does not contain a verb. Looked at by itself, we do not know what is being said about the tombstones in the cemetery.
<br><br>
How to fix it: add a verb.
<br>
<i>There were people laying flowers on tombstones in the Manawaka cemetery.
<br><br>
I was late for church. Because Bram was drunk again.</i>
<br><br>
The phrase is a dependent clause; it provides additional information about the independent clause. By itself, it does not provide a complete thought.
<br><br>
How to fix it: change the punctuation.

<br><i>I was late for church, because Bram was drunk again. <br></i><br>
OR
<br><i><br> I was late for church. Because Bram was drunk again, I missed the reverend's sermon.
